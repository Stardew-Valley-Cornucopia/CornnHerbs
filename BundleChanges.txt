About: 
- Should be on balance with the base game bundles. 
- Should (I hope) only contain items currently implemented in game. 
  The exception to this is the change from red cabbage to Juniper. 
  This now allows for guaranteed Y1 completion, but still provides a  challenge and planning ahead. 
- No machine rewards were changed, since CustomMachines do not have an ID number. 
- All food rewards are replaced with our new meals. Replaced meals have similar worth in gold to the originals, so balance will be similar. 
   ** Will need to return to this when we finalize buffs, so buffs will be in balance with originals as well. ** 
- Other rewards are intended to remain balanced, while letting players see parts of the mod that wouldn't be available for purchase  yet. Ex: Omni Geode (5) to Iridium Fern Seeds (2). Since omni geodes can give players iridium ore, this should be similar in balance, while giving the player a glimpse of what seeds they can look forward to buying in future years. 
- The changes to Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter foraging will now require the player to grow 1 plant for each. I chose plants that have a short growth time and were labeled as foragables, since these bundles are intended to be completed quickly. 
- Truffle Oil -> Pink Essential Oil is only pink, because we are unable to set Essential Oil as a generic type. In testing, pink seems easy to make due to Salmonberries. I saw this as balanced since they alembic requires hardwood to craft, but I'm open to suggestions.
