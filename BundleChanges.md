## About Changes:
- Should be on balance with the base game bundles.
- Should (I hope) only contain items currently implemented in game.
  - The exception to this is the change from red cabbage to juniper.
  This now allows for guaranteed Y1 completion, but still provides a  challenge and planning ahead.
- No machine rewards were changed, since CustomMachines do not have an ID number.
- All food rewards are replaced with our new meals. Replaced meals have similar worth in gold to the originals, so balance will be similar.
   - *Will need to return to this when we finalize buffs, so buffs will be in balance with originals as well. Would like to keep fishing buff -> fishing buff, for example*
- Other rewards are intended to remain balanced, while letting players see parts of the mod that wouldn't be available for purchase  yet.
  - Ex: Omni Geode (5) to Iridium Fern Seeds (2).
    - Since omni geodes can give players iridium ore, this should be similar in balance, while giving the player a glimpse of what seeds they can look forward to buying in future years.
- The changes to Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter foraging will now require the player to grow 1 plant for each. I chose plants that have a short growth time and were labeled as foragables, since these bundles are intended to be completed quickly.
  - *Contemplating if these are appropriate changes, or if we should instead only change rewards here.*
- Truffle Oil -> Pink Essential Oil is only pink, because we are unable to set Essential Oil as a generic type. In testing, pink seems easy to make due to Salmonberries. I saw this as balanced since they alembic requires hardwood to craft, but I'm open to suggestions.

## Possible Alternative to Incorporate Themes of Our Mod:
- The amount of options need to remain the same, or the code won't work.
- All bundle requirements still from Y1 only
- **Crafts Room**
  - Spring Flowers
    - Y2 spring flower seed (2) as reward (Fairy Duster)
  - Summer Flowers
    - Y2 summer flower seed (2) as reward
  - Fall Flowers
    - Y2 summer flower seed (2) as reward
  - Winter Foraging -> ??
  - Construction Bundle (mostly same, unless there's a better idea)
  - Herbalist (changed from Exotic)
    - Same amount of options, but switched to a couple herbs the player grows
    - Other options will be based on ways to process herbs (ground, oil, candles, etc.)
    - thyme, Basil, [color] essential oil, dried yellow flower, dried green herbs, Beeswax, oak resin, pine tar, Morel
      - Pine tar & morel will be switched (need ideas)
    - Reward will still be food item
  - *All 3 flowers and herbalist would need new artwork to reflect theme*
- **Pantry**
  - Spring -> Fruits
    - 1 fruit/season
    - Strawberry, Blueberry, Watermelon, juniper berries
    - *Needs art*
  - Summer -> Vegetables
    - 1 vegetable/season (exc. winter)

    - Keeps need for animals
    - 6 options available
    - yogurt (Large milk until implemented), goat butter, corn flour (rice flour while corn not implemented), raisins, stuffed bell peppers, brown sugar
      - types will need to be specific & available in Y1 to make
    - *Needs art*
  - Artisan -> Artisan
      - instead of current options, will use our new artisan goods, while keeping 2 (?) old ones. Won't include wine, since there'll be a brewer bundle.
      - 12 options available
      - honey, jelly, coconut oil, soap (not implemented, currently using cottonseed oil), cheese, persimmon, candle, etc. (all base game fruits still in, until more of our artisan good are implemented)
      - reward undecided
      - *Art not needed, but can be changed*
- **Fishing**
  - All bundles same w/ food reward changed
  - Alternatively, we could replace one fish per bundle with a Y1 recipe made using a fish from that bundle.

- **Boiler Room**
  - Blacksmith's Bundle
    - Keep the same
  - Geologist's Bundle
    - Same?
    - Change reward to Iridium Fern Seeds like in current Changes
  - Adventurer's Bundle
